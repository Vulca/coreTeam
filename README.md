# In mobility we trust 


## Today we are thinking about 4 main branches.

1. **Vulca tours.** To explore, discover and connect new spaces.
2. **Exchanges groups.** Spaces + makers in mobility. This is the ressource. = Raw data/impact.
3. **Science group.** Analysts, phd and students. To analyse impact and transform the ressource = Refined data/impact
4. **M&M's.** Managment & marketing to support teams and sell the reports to public/private institutions (=money)

_basic mining scheme._  

But we MUST avoid to fall in an extractive model and building the model to be regenerative.  
It MUST be beneficial for the maker/space who produce the impact.  
Vulca as a 4th sector activity, for benefit not for profit.  
Our work must be financed but the extra benefice is reinvested for the common good.
